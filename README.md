# translate
a library built with python to use google's translate API and get mp3 files directly. This supports many languages that google's speech
synthenizer does not.

This library is meant for python 3 and combines the standard google translate API with the python gtts library. This enables you
to get mp3 translations directly.

Note that you need an API key for this.
